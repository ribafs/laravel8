## Complete Beginners Guide on Laravel Livewire Events

Hello devs in this tutorial i am going to discuss about Laravel livewire events. You already know thatÂ Livewire components can communicate with each other through a global event system. As long as two Livewire components are living on the same page, they can communicate using events and listeners.
If you already worked with vue events then livewire events is going to be almost same thing i think. If you use larave livewire already then you know about thatÂ Laravel LivewireÂ simplifies so many aspects of building out yourÂ LaravelÂ application.

Livewire makes it easy to send data from theÂ clientÂ to theÂ serverÂ and from theÂ serverÂ back to theÂ client.In this quick example tutorial, I'll show you how easy it is to send data back and forth from theÂ clientÂ and theÂ server.

## Client To The Server with Livewire

In laravel livewire sending events from theÂ clientÂ to theÂ serverÂ can easily be accomplished with aÂ wire:clickÂ event like

 <button wire:click="functionName">Click Me</button> 
Â 
This is covered in theÂ Livewire Actions Documentation, but what if we wanted to call aÂ PHPÂ function from vanillaÂ javascript? Simple enough, we can utilizeÂ Livewire 
EventsÂ to do that like so:
```html
<script>
    window.livewire.emit('say-hello');
</script> 
```
Â 
After doing that steps, inside of our PHP code, you'll need to register an event listener that maps to a function:
```html
protected $listeners = ['say-hello' => 'sayHello'];

public function sayHello()
{
    // your code here
}
```
Â 
That's the simplest and very easy way for yourÂ front-endÂ to talk to yourÂ back-end. Next, we'll see how we can send an event from theÂ back-endÂ to theÂ front-end in this tutorial with laravel livewire events.

## Server to the Client with Livewire

Sending events from the server to the client can be done by utilizing theÂ dispatchBrowserEventÂ function in laravel livewire. See the exampleÂ like so:
```html
public function sayGoodbye()
{
    $this->dispatchBrowserEvent('say-goodbye', []);
}
```
Â 
Then, we can register an even listener in javascript to catch this event like below
```html
<script>
window.addEventListener('say-goodbye', event => {
    alert('Radical!');
});
</script> 
```
Â 
And that's it ğŸ™ŒÂ Finally, you may like to know how to send data between the sever to clinet and client to server.

## Sending Data to the Server

In our previous code example, we can easily pass data to the server with the following javascript code:
```html
<script>
    window.livewire.emit('say-hello', { name : 'John' );
</script> 
```

Â 
And we can access that data from the first argument in our function:
```html
protected $listeners = ['say-hello' => 'sayHello'];

public function sayHello($payload)
{
    $name = $payload['name'];
    // your code here
}
```
Â 
That's great, right?Â Next step, we'll also need a way to pass data from our server to our client.

## Sending Data to the Client

We already seen before thatÂ we can easily send data from our PHP code to ourÂ front-endÂ by sending it in the array of ourÂ dispatchBrowserEventÂ function:
```html
public function sayGoodbye()
{
    $this->dispatchBrowserEvent('say-goodbye', ['name' => 'John']);
}
```
Â 
And we can capture that data in javascript by fetching theÂ event.detailÂ variable.
```html
<script>
window.addEventListener('say-goodbye', event => {
    alert( event.detail.name );
});
</script> 
```
